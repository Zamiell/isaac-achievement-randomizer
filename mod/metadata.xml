Achievement Randomizer is a mod that gives you the experience of playing through the game from scratch, unlocking each item one by one in a randomized way.

This mod does not simply randomize all of the vanilla achievements. Rather, it has custom objectives and custom unlocks. Unlike vanilla, almost everything you can imagine is locked from the start of the game. That means you will have to beat your the first run as Isaac with only Breakfast in the item pools!

For more specific details about why we designed it this way and what exact things are locked, read [url=https://github.com/Zamiell/isaac-achievement-randomizer/blob/main/docs/about.md]the manual on GitHub[/url].
