Additionally, the following bosses are excluded entirely:

- Mom's Heart (#8) (inaccessible on a fully unlocked save file)
- Gish (#19) (would be unfair since the boss is extremely rare)
- C.H.A.D. (#21) (would be unfair since the boss is extremely rare)
- Triachnid (#42) (would be unfair since the boss is extremely rare)
- Delirium (#70) (would be unfair since the boss is poorly designed)
- Raglich (#98) (unfinished boss, there are no actual boss rooms)

Note that you are not able to accomplish a boss objective while in a Double Trouble room (since that would give you more room to dodge).

> Tip: A timer will appear on the screen if a boss is in the room and the corresponding objective has not yet been accomplished.

- DELETE THIS (#45) (since TMTRAINER is banned)
