# Achievement Randomizer Objective List

## Character-Based Objectives (1122)

Each character will unlock something upon defeating/completing the following:

1. Mom
2. It Lives
3. Isaac
4. Blue Baby
5. Satan
6. The Lamb
7. Mega Satan
8. Boss Rush
9. Hush
10. Ultra Greed
11. Mother
12. The Beast

(Delirium is not included since the design of the boss is considered by the player-base to be extremely sub-par.)

Additionally, each character will unlock something upon full-clearing each chapter without getting hit:

1. Basement (floor 1 + floor 2) <!-- 13 -->
2. Caves (floor 3 + floor 4) <!-- 14 -->
3. Depths (floor 5 + floor 6) <!-- 15 -->
4. Womb (floor 7 + floor 8) <!-- 16 -->

> Tip: A Crown of Light icon will appear next to the coin count UI when the "no hit" objective has not yet been accomplished for the particular character and chapter combination.

Each character objective must be completed on both normal mode and hard mode.

> Tip: By default, completing an objective on hard mode will not complete the corresponding normal mode objective. This is intended because accomplishing one objective should only result in one unlock. If you think this is unfair, you can turn on the "double unlocks" setting in the menu.
